## Abstract

In the rapidly evolving landscape of virtual reality
and the Internet of Things (IoT), The growth of edge computing
has reached remarkable heights. Our study presents a new
approach to acoustic-based localization that capitalizes on the
ubiquity of smartphones, converting them into advanced instruments for human-computer interaction. This represents a significant departure from previous systems that demanded multiple
speakers, complex equipment, and considerable computational
power. Our refined method enables accurate and immediate onedimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) finger tracking with
the use of ordinary smartphones.


Our system emits ultrasonic waves from a smartphone, undetectable by humans. We designed precise algorithms to analyze
ultrasonic wavefronts to detect the echoes and discern localization cues. We use the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence, modulated
through the Phase Shift Keying (PSK) technique. In synergy,
a Moving Target Indicator (MTI) filter is employed to restrain
background reflections and extract target echoes. Experimental
results demonstrate that our solution can precisely track the
1D and 2D positions. Our system exemplifies the integration of
acoustic sensing within the IoT framework, unleashing significant
potential for applications.
